1. **PR #4 Review** - BE003 Monitor CRUD (enables full integration)  
2. **PR #3 Fix** - AI coordination files (unblocks AI development track)
3. **Integration Testing** - Connect FE004 forms to BE003 APIs
4. **Welcome New BE Dev** - Second backend developer joining

**Success Criteria:**
- Both PRs approved and merged
- Frontend-backend integration working
- New developer onboarded and productive

### Architecture Status

**Current Focus**: Technical feasibility assessment for temporal logic separation

The Product Owner has identified the core innovation correctly - the temporal logic separation for change detection. This is architecturally sound and I'm preparing detailed technical implementation strategies.

### Key Technical Decisions Under Consideration

#### 1. Temporal Logic Architecture
- **Fact Storage**: PostgreSQL with optimized time-series indexing
- **Change Detection**: Event-driven architecture with state comparison engine
- **Historical Data**: Partitioned tables for efficient temporal queries
- **Performance**: Redis caching layer for recent state values

#### 2. AI Integration Strategy
- **Provider Abstraction**: Interface-based design for Claude/OpenAI switching
- **Prompt Classification**: Dedicated classifier service for monitor types
- **Fact Extraction**: Structured output parsing with validation
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent batching and caching of AI calls

#### 3. Technology Stack Recommendations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ (superior to MongoDB for temporal data)
- **Queue System**: BullMQ with Redis for monitor evaluation scheduling
- **Email Service**: AWS SES (most cost-effective for beta)
- **Session Store**: Redis for authentication sessions
- **Background Jobs**: Node.js workers with PM2 process management

### Pending Clarifications Impact

Several Product Owner questions will significantly impact architecture:
- Q2: Custom vs AI-determined scheduling affects queue design
- Q6: Portal integration affects authentication architecture
- Q10: Provider switching criteria affects abstraction layer design
- Q12: History retention affects database partitioning strategy

### Next Steps (Blocked)
1. Awaiting PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md completion
2. Ready to create SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md immediately upon spec receipt
3. Prepared to define task distributions for all development teams

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Core temporal logic is well-defined and achievable
- **Medium Risk**: AI provider costs at scale need monitoring
- **Low Risk**: Technology stack is proven and scalable

### Recommendations for Product Owner
1. For Q1: Recommend AWS SES for cost-effectiveness
2. For Q2: Suggest hybrid approach - AI recommendations with user override
3. For Q6: Recommend integrated SvelteKit app with route-based portal
4. For Q12: Suggest 90-day retention for beta, expandable later

### Key Architecture Decisions Finalized

#### Updated Based on Product Clarifications
1. **Product Name**: "Monitors!" (not MonitorHub)
2. **Manual Refresh Only**: No automatic scheduling, user-triggered with rate limiting
3. **Rate Limiting**: 50 requests/day per user (configurable via feature flags)
4. **Web Scraping**: Puppeteer/Playwright for data extraction (no APIs in v1)
5. **Admin Panel**: Full beta user management capabilities
6. **Email Service**: SendGrid for transactional emails
7. **Data Retention**: 1 year with quarterly partitioning
8. **Monitor Templates**: Pre-built examples for onboarding

### NEW ITERATIVE APPROACH - 4 WEEK PLAN

**Week 1 - FOUNDATION**
- User signup/login ‚úì
- Monitor CRUD ‚úì
- Database schema ‚úì
- Result: Users can create monitors (inactive)

**Week 2 - AI CORE**
- Claude API integration ‚úì
- Manual evaluation ‚úì
- Result: Monitors can be checked manually

**Week 3 - AUTOMATION**
- Email notifications ‚úì
- State change detection ‚úì
- Result: Monitors work end-to-end

**Week 4 - POLISH**
- Rate limiting ‚úì
- Dashboard ‚úì
- Onboarding ‚úì
- Result: Beta ready (2 users)

### Immediate Blockers
1. **NO DEVELOPERS** - 1 Lead, 0 implementation capacity
2. **NO DATABASE** - Can't store anything
3. **NO AUTH** - Can't identify users
4. **NO AI** - Core value proposition missing

### Risk Assessment: MANAGEABLE üü°
- Iterative approach reduces risk significantly
- Each week delivers testable value
- 90 requirements become backlog, not burden
- Clear priorities prevent feature creep

### Key Insights from Phase 6-7
- **Worst UX**: Confusion (must prevent)
- **Key Metric**: Active users (weekly login + alerts)
- **Reality**: Need developers to execute
- **Focus**: 5 core features first, iterate from there
