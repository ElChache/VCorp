**Task ID**: UX004  
**Designer**: ux_sonnet_001_k2f8  
**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Version**: 1.0

## Overview

Design for an intuitive, AI-powered monitor creation experience that transforms natural language descriptions into functional monitoring configurations. The interface emphasizes clarity, guidance, and user confidence throughout the process.

## 1. Natural Language Input Interface Design

### Primary Input Interface
- **Large text area** (minimum 3 rows, expanding automatically)
- **Placeholder text**: "Describe what you want to monitor... (e.g., 'Tell me when Bitcoin goes above $50,000' or 'Monitor if my favorite restaurant has any new menu items')"
- **Character counter**: Shows remaining characters out of 500 max
- **Smart suggestions**: Auto-complete based on common monitoring patterns

### Input Enhancement Features
- **Example prompts carousel**: Rotating display of 5-6 example prompts with categories:
  - Financial: "Alert me when AAPL stock drops below $150"
  - Weather: "Notify me when it will rain tomorrow in San Francisco"
  - Sports: "Tell me when the Lakers win their next game"
  - News: "Monitor for any news about AI regulation"
  - Shopping: "Watch for price drops on iPhone 15 Pro"
- **Voice input option**: Microphone icon for dictating prompts (progressive enhancement)
- **Real-time validation**: Gentle highlighting of potentially unclear phrases

## 2. AI Processing Loading States and Progress

### Processing Flow Visualization
1. **Initial Processing** (0-2 seconds)
   - Animated pulse around text input
   - Text: "Understanding your request..."
   
2. **Prompt Analysis** (2-5 seconds)
   - Progress bar with segments:
     - Analyzing prompt ▓▓▓░░
     - Identifying data sources ▓▓▓▓░
     - Configuring monitoring ▓▓▓▓▓
   
3. **AI Interpretation** (5-8 seconds)
   - Spinner with descriptive text:
   - "Determining monitoring type..."
   - "Finding data sources..."
   - "Setting up tracking..."

### Progress Communication
- **Estimated time remaining**: "About 10 seconds remaining"
- **Cancel option**: Prominent "Cancel" button throughout process
- **Background processing indicator**: Subtle animation continues if user navigates away

## 3. Monitor Interpretation Display and Editing

## 6. Error Handling and Improvement Suggestions

### Error Types and Solutions

#### Ambiguous Prompts
```
⚠️ We need a bit more detail

"Monitor Apple" could mean several things:
• Apple stock price changes
• News about Apple Inc.
• Apple product releases

Try being more specific: "Alert me when Apple stock goes above $180"
```

#### Unsupported Data Sources
```
❌ Can't access that data source yet

We can't monitor private social media accounts or restricted websites.

Similar things we can monitor:
• Public news about the topic
• Related stock prices
• Industry announcements
```

#### Technical Limitations
```
🔧 Almost there, but we need to adjust something

Checking every minute might be too frequent and could hit rate limits.

How about:
• Check once per hour ✅
• Manual refresh only ✅
• Check once per day ✅
```

### Improvement Suggestions
- **Refinement prompts**: "To make this more accurate, try adding..."
- **Alternative approaches**: "Instead of monitoring X, consider monitoring Y which gives similar insights"
- **Enhancement options**: "You could also monitor related metrics like..."
