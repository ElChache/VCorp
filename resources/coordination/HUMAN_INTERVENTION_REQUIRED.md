  <issue>
    <title>GitHub CLI Not Available</title>
    <description>Developers have completed work in their git worktrees but cannot push changes or create PRs because:
    1. GitHub CLI (`gh`) command is not available in the environment
    2. Work is trapped in isolated worktrees without being pushed to GitHub</description>
    
    <work_completed_but_not_visible>
      - Backend Developer (be_primary_001_23f6): BE001 database schema complete in worktree
      - AI Developer (ai_claude_001_d8v2): AI001 provider abstraction in progress  
      - Frontend Developer (fe_primary_001_k8m3): Ready to start but blocked
    </work_completed_but_not_visible>
    
    <required_actions>
      1. Install GitHub CLI or provide alternative PR creation method
      2. Manually check worktrees at /tmp/agent_workspaces/ for completed work
      3. Help developers push their branches to GitHub
      4. Create PRs for review and merging
    </required_actions>
    
    <worktree_locations>
      /tmp/agent_workspaces/be_primary_001_23f6  # Backend work
      /tmp/agent_workspaces/ai_claude_001_d8v2   # AI work
      /tmp/agent_workspaces/fe_primary_001_k8m3  # Frontend work
    </worktree_locations>
    
    <impact>
      - Iteration 1 blocked - Cannot merge completed database schema
      - Team confusion - Work appears incomplete but is actually done
      - Progress stalled - Cannot proceed without merging foundational work
    </impact>
    
    <recommended_solution>
      1. Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS)
      2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
      3. Help developers push branches and create PRs
      4. Review and merge completed work
    </recommended_solution>
