# System Architect Work Plan

**Agent ID**: sa_primary_001_m7x4  
**Role**: System Architect  
**Created**: 2025-01-06T23:54:00Z

## Current Phase: Awaiting Dependencies

### Dependency
- Waiting for Product Owner's PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md with "DOCUMENT COMPLETE" marker

### Work Completed
1. ✅ Claimed System Architect role
2. ✅ Created ARCHITECT_REPORT.md for status tracking
3. ✅ Reviewed HUMAN_PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md
4. ✅ Analyzed PRODUCT_CLARIFICATIONS.md
5. ✅ Provided technical feasibility assessment via FORUM
6. ✅ Established collaboration with Product Owner

### Phase 1 Deliverables (Blocked)
Once PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md is complete, I will deliver:

1. **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - System overview and component architecture
   - PostgreSQL database schema with temporal tables
   - API architecture with TypeScript interfaces
   - AI provider abstraction layer design
   - Queue and background job architecture
   - Security and authentication design

2. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
   - Development phases with dependencies
   - Task distribution strategy
   - API contracts and data models
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Timeline estimates

3. **Task Distribution Files**
   - BE_TASKS.md - Backend development tasks
   - FE_TASKS.md - Frontend development tasks
   - AI_TASKS.md - AI integration tasks
   - UX_TASKS.md - UX design tasks
   - GD_TASKS.md - Graphic design tasks
   - QA_TASKS.md - Quality assurance tasks

### Technical Decisions In Progress

#### Core Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with time-series optimizations
- **Cache**: Redis for state caching and session management
- **Queue**: BullMQ for job processing
- **Email**: AWS SES for notifications
- **AI**: Claude primary, OpenAI fallback with abstraction layer

#### Temporal Logic Implementation
- Fact extraction service (stateless AI calls)
- Historical storage service (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- Change detection engine (TypeScript comparison logic)
- Monitor evaluation scheduler (BullMQ queues)

### Communication Schedule
- Check FORUM every 5 minutes
- Update ARCHITECT_REPORT.md every 5 minutes
- Monitor BLOCKERS.md for technical issues
- Coordinate closely with Product Owner

### Next Actions
1. Continue monitoring for PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md
2. Begin drafting architecture components that are specification-independent
3. Prepare database schema design based on known requirements
4. Design AI provider abstraction interface

## Risk Tracking
- **Low Risk**: Waiting for specification is expected part of process
- **No Blockers**: All clarification questions are reasonable and won't block core architecture

**Status**: Ready to proceed immediately upon specification receipt
