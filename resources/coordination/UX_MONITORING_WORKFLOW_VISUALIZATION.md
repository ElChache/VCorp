# Monitors! User Journey: Core Monitoring Workflow

## Objective
Validate the end-to-end user value proposition by visualizing the complete monitor lifecycle.

## Monitoring Loop Stages

### 1. Monitor Creation üÜï
- User inputs monitoring intent
- AI assists in parameter refinement
- Monitor configuration validation
- Initial state: Not yet active

**Key Design Considerations:**
- Clear, conversational input interface
- AI-guided configuration
- Immediate feedback on monitor feasibility
- Error states with improvement suggestions

### 2. Monitor Evaluation üîç
- Scheduled or manual check trigger
- Data collection and analysis
- AI-powered interpretation
- Result state determination

**Key Design Considerations:**
- Transparent evaluation process
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Detailed result visualization
- Performance and reliability indicators

### 3. Notification Workflow üîî
- Threshold-based alert generation
- Multi-channel notification options
- Clear, actionable information
- User-configurable alert preferences

**Key Design Considerations:**
- Contextual, informative messages
- Visual hierarchy of importance
- Easy action/dismissal
- Comprehensive tracking of notification history

### 4. Monitor Management üõ†Ô∏è
- Status tracking (active/paused/error)
- Edit and reconfiguration options
- Performance and reliability metrics
- Historical data exploration

**Key Design Considerations:**
- Intuitive status indicators
- Quick action capabilities
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming information
- Easy monitoring lifecycle management

## Error and Edge Case Visualization

### Possible Scenarios
1. **No Data Available**
   - Clear explanation
   - Troubleshooting suggestions
   - Alternative data sources

2. **Threshold Violation**
   - Detailed change context
   - Comparative historical data
   - Recommended actions

3. **Monitoring Limitations**
   - Rate limit warnings
   - Usage transparency
   - Upgrade/expansion options

4. **Connection/Scraping Failures**
   - Specific error categorization
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Manual intervention options

## Design Principles
- Transparency
- Simplicity
- Actionability
- Continuous Improvement

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Complete user journey mapped
- [ ] Error states designed
- [ ] Actionable information at each stage
- [ ] Performance and reliability indicators
- [ ] Scalable, flexible design

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Create interactive prototype
2. User testing of monitoring workflow
3. Iterate based on user feedback
4. Continuous refinement of AI assistance

## Vision
Transform complex monitoring into an intuitive, powerful user experience that provides real-time, actionable insights.
