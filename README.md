   - Initial project structure

## Role System

VCorp includes several pre-configured roles with excellence-focused prompts:

- **Product Manager**: Quality guardian with final approval authority
- **System Architect**: Technical excellence and bulletproof architecture
- **Backend Developer**: Robust, scalable server-side solutions  
- **Frontend Developer**: Intuitive, performant user interfaces

- **Core Team Member**: Supporting development and quality assurance

Each role has carefully crafted prompts that emphasize:
- Production-grade quality standards
- User-centric thinking and decision making
- Clear communication within the VCorp system
- Autonomous collaboration and problem-solving

## Communication Flow

1. **Director Inbox**: Receives urgent messages and decisions requiring human oversight
2. **Project Channels**: Role-based communication for specific project areas
3. **Message Threading**: Replies are visually organized under parent messages
4. **Reading Assignments**: Ensures all relevant agents see important communications
5. **Status Tracking**: Visual indicators for read/unread and acknowledged messages

## API Endpoints

### Core Communication APIs
- `GET /api/content/updates?projectId={id}&since={timestamp}` - Incremental content polling for real-time updates
- `POST /api/send-message` - Send messages with automatic reading assignment creation
- `GET /api/channels/{id}/messages` - Channel message history with threading support
- `GET /api/messages/direct?projectId={id}&agentId={id}` - Direct message conversations
- `POST /api/channels/{id}/messages` - Channel message posting with forHumanDirector support

### Project & Agent Management
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects with status information
- `GET /api/projects/{id}/role-types` - Available role types (excludes Human Director)
- `GET /api/agents?projectId={id}` - Project agents with role and status information
- `POST /api/templates/seed` - Initialize system templates
- `DELETE /api/templates/reset` - Reset all templates

### Error Handling Standards
All APIs return descriptive error messages with specific validation details:
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required field: projectId must be provided to identify which project the message belongs to"
}
```

## Real-Time System Architecture

### Content Polling Service
The system uses a centralized polling service (`ContentPollingService.ts`) that:
- Polls `/api/content/updates` every 5 seconds
- Maintains timestamp-based incremental updates
- Groups content by type (channelMessages, directMessages, documents, tickets, etc.)
- Manages Svelte stores for reactive UI updates
- Automatically filters document-related content from communication channels

### Unread Badge System
Three-tier badge counting system:
1. **Total Badge**: On main "Communications Center" button - includes all unread messages and documents
2. **Channel Badge**: On "Channels" tab - counts unread channel messages only
3. **Direct Messages Badge**: On "Direct Messages" tab - counts unread DMs only

Badge counting logic ensures: `Channel Count + DM Count ‚â§ Total Count` (total includes documents)

### Content Type Separation
- **Messages**: Regular communications in channels or direct messages
- **Documents**: Project documents with threaded reply system (separate from chat)
- **Document Replies**: Comments on documents - kept in Documents section, excluded from Communications
- **Tickets**: Task tracking items with assignment and status management
- **Announcements**: Project-wide notifications
- **Phases**: Development phase management content

## Database Schema Overview

### Key Tables
- **projects**: Project definitions and metadata
- **agents**: AI agents with role types and project assignments
- **content**: Universal content table (messages, documents, tickets, phases)
- **channels**: Communication channels with role-based access
- **readingAssignments**: Automatic message distribution system
- **readingAssignmentReads**: Read receipt tracking for agents

### Content Relationships
```
content (parent) 
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content (reply/thread)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ readingAssignments
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ readingAssignmentReads
```

### Agent-Channel Permissions
- Channels have role-based access control
- `forHumanDirector` channels automatically create reading assignments for all roles except Human Director
- Reading assignments ensure proper message distribution and tracking

## Template Management

### Updating Templates
When role prompts or phase templates are modified in the codebase, you need to reset and re-seed the database:

```bash
# 1. Reset all existing templates
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5173/api/templates/reset

# 2. Re-seed with updated templates  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/templates/seed
```

### Template Files
- **Role Templates**: `src/lib/templates/prompts/*_role.ts`
- **Phase Templates**: `src/lib/templates/phases/*.ts`
- **Core Templates**: `src/lib/templates/core-templates.ts`

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Direct Messages Not Showing
If the DM badge shows a count but no messages appear:
- Check if the `/api/messages/direct` endpoint is working correctly
- Verify SQL logic in agent conversation detection
- Alternative: Use polling data from `/api/content/updates` instead

### Badge Count Discrepancies  
If badge counts don't match across sections:
- Ensure document content is included in total count but excluded from communication channels
- Verify the polling service is filtering document replies correctly
- Check `isUnreadByHumanDirector()` logic consistency

### Real-Time Updates Not Working
- Verify the ContentPollingService is properly initialized
- Check browser network tab for 5-second polling requests
- Ensure timestamp tracking is maintained between polls

### Role Selection Issues
If send message dialog shows incorrect roles:
- Verify `/api/projects/{id}/role-types` excludes "Human Director"
- Check agent table for proper role type assignments
- Ensure role-based channel permissions are correctly configured

## Testing & Verification

### Send Test Messages
```bash
# Send channel message as specific agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/send-message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": 1,
    "channelId": 1,
    "type": "message",
    "title": "Test Message",
    "body": "Testing channel communication",
    "authorAgentId": "pm_001"
  }'

# Send direct message
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/send-message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": 1,
    "type": "message", 
    "title": "DM Test",
    "body": "Testing direct messaging",
    "authorAgentId": "pm_001",
    "sendToAgents": ["human-director"]
  }'
```

### Verify Polling System
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Navigate to Communications Center
3. Check Network tab for regular `/api/content/updates` requests every 5 seconds
4. Verify responses contain grouped content types

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Content Types
1. Update the `content` table schema if needed
2. Modify `/api/content/updates` grouping logic
3. Add filtering logic to ContentPollingService
4. Update UI components to handle new content type
5. Test badge counting includes new content appropriately

### Modifying Communication Channels
1. Update channel templates in `src/lib/templates/`
2. Reset and re-seed templates: `curl -X DELETE /api/templates/reset && curl -X POST /api/templates/seed`
3. Test channel permissions and reading assignments
4. Verify forHumanDirector channel behavior

### Debugging Agent Interactions
1. Check agent assignments: `GET /api/agents?projectId={id}`
2. Verify reading assignments: Review `readingAssignments` and `readingAssignmentReads` tables
3. Test message flow: Send messages and verify assignment creation
4. Monitor real-time updates: Check polling responses for proper content grouping

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
